%h1 Quick start

%p
  Guess you have installed vertexdb, so lets start.
  
%p
  VertexDB stores data similar with file system or objects in memory of dynamic programming languages like JavaScript, Ruby etc.

%p 
  Every node has key and value.
  %br
  If first character of key is <code>'_'<code> - it contains string value.
  Else - it's link to another node.

%p
  Lets make example object. It'll be some person.

%pre
  :preserve
    !!JSON
    {
      "_first_name": "Benjamin",
      "_last_name":  "Smith"
    }
